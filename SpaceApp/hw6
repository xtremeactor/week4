Homework 6: Refactoring project

1. Create two new layers to the app:
    1. Model layer: model class, properties within that model (cameraPosition: String, imageURL: String)
        1. Normal way of creating model classes
        2. Use ObjectMapper https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper
    2. Service layer: Singleton object that can be called within your other classes, create a method to allow getting of responses by passing a url string
        1. Alamofire

2. Redo the structure of the storyboard. 1 VC -> Container View -> Table View
    Implement tableview and add logic to handle which camera position is passed in.
    1. In the table view, replace the web view with a UIImageView and load in the images accordingly using SDWebImage https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage
    2. Scale the image accordingly to make it fit

3. Ensure that the app works across different size devices
